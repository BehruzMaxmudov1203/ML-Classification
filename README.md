# ML-Classification and Customer Churn

![Machine Learning](images/ml_classification.png)

## Overview

This repository contains projects and exercises on classification algorithms and customer churn prediction with animations and visualizations. The goal is to learn, implement, and evaluate machine learning models, including practical portfolio projects.

We cover:

- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Customer churn prediction with ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost)

## Customer Churn Prediction

### Topics

- What is Customer Churn?  
- Customer Churn: Data Analysis  
- Logistic Regression, SVM, ROC Curve  
- Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Jupyter Notebook: Customer Churn  
- Final practice: Customer Churn prediction  

### Overview

Customer churn refers to customers stopping use of a service or product. Predicting churn allows businesses to retain valuable clients. Models include Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
